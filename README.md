# Design_BeehiveSimulator

This project has been developed using design patterns and Autofac for 
dependency Injection.
The project has been created in a way that strikes a balance between
Design and simplicity, trying to minimize the impact of complexity in the 
behavior of each of the entities. 
I have enjoyed a lot in developing this little gem and I hope you enjoy 
the code too. 

Happy Coding!
